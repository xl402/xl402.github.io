# 1. Introduction
Bayesian inference offers an attractive story with principled uncertainty estimation and the ability to combine expert knowledge into the model. For reasons that will hopefully become clear later, the challenge in Bayesian inference is to be able to provide both fast and scalable products during both development and serving. In this post, I will summarise what variational inference is trying to solve, it's benefits and potential pitfalls. I will then introduce the mean-field method, and use it to solve a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model. In the second post, I will elaborate on black-box variational inference methods.

VI is an advanced topic, so intermediate-level probability theory and ML knowledge are assumed. Knowledge of the [*Kullback–Leibler*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErfnhcEV1O8) (KL) divergence is also expected. To better understand Bayesian GMM (which will be maths heavy), I would like to recommend my previous post on [Expectation Maximisation](https://xl402.github.io/posts/em) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REypj2sy_5U&t=329s) video for intuition. Let's dive in!

## 2. Theory of VI
### 2.1 What is it trying to solve?
Let's start with the classic bayesian inference equation:
`$$p(\theta|X) = \dfrac{p(X|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(X)}$$`
in words:
`$$\text{posterior} = \dfrac{\text{likelihood}\times\text{prior}}{\text{evidence}}$$`
following this equation, there are three steps involving developing a Bayesian inference model.
1. Build a **generative model**: choose prior and choose likelihood, i.e. how can our data be generated using a probabilistic model? (GMM for discovering mixtures, LDA for discovering topics)
2. Compute posterior
3. Report a summary, e.g. posterior means and (co)variances. i.e. inform your boss/client about the 'insights' provided by the model.

Each of the three steps alone requires a separate blog post(s). We only focus on step 2, i.e. how do we compute the posterior? This is in fact a very hard problem because of the normalising `$p(X)$` (evidence) term. The only way to evaluate it is to compute:
`$$p(X) = \int_\theta p(X|\theta)p(\theta)$$`
suppose in our model, our parameter space includes things like "cluster mean" `$\mu_1, \cdots \mu_M$`, "cluster variance" `$\sigma^2_1, \cdots \sigma^2_M$`, etc, this integral over `$\theta$` becomes:
`$$p(X) = \int_{\mu_1}\cdots \int_{\mu_M}\int_{\sigma^2_1}\cdots \int_{\sigma^2_M} p(X|\mu_1, \cdots \sigma^2_M)d\mu_1\cdots d\sigma^2_M$$`

not really looking pretty... since we are integrating over some pretty complicated, high dimensional function over a high dimensional space. As with a lot of real life problems, this integration typically has no closed form, and it will be extremely inefficient to use numerical integration tools due to the high dimensionality.
The gold standard approach to obtain the posterior `$p(\theta|X)$` is to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which deserves a separate blog post. But in short MCMC provides an unbiased estimate of the posterior, i.e. if you run it for long enough, you are guaranteed to become arbitrarily close to the posterior. But we run into the same problem of "running it for long enough", turns out, for large dataset and parameters, "long enough" is "too long to be acceptable for development/production". What would be a **fast** and **reliable** (good enough approximate) of the posterior? Here comes variational inference!

### 2.1 VI Overview
Essentially, variational inference turns the *numerical integral* problem into an *optimisation* problem. Remember what we want to obtain is the posterior distribution `$p(\theta|X)$`, which can be pretty complicated looking (we in fact don't normally know what it looks like). In VI, we try to approximate this distribution with a *nice* distribution `$q(\theta)$` (more on *"nice"* later, for now, picture Gaussian). Graphically speaking, left figure below shows what we might want to achieve:

<p></p>

To think about this in terms of optimisation: the posterior distribution lives in some complicated space, we wish to find the optimum distribution `$q^*(\theta)$` which is *closest* to the posterior, and come from a family of *"nice"* distribution (pictorially shown on the right). i.e.
`$$q^* = \arg\min_{q\in Q}c(q(\theta), p(\theta|X))$$`
with `$c$` being the "closeness" function. Two things we need to further define - what is *"nice"* and what is *"close"*?
Let's talk about *"nice"* first. Recall what we really want at the end of the day is to be able to report **mean** and **variance** of the (approximated) posterior distribution. Hence the family of distributions `$Q$` are typically:
- low dimensional (which motivates the idea of mean-field as we will see later)
- often belong to the [exponential family](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/411893/advantages-of-the-exponential-family-why-should-we-study-it-and-use-it) (Gaussian, exponential, Bernoulli, categorical, beta, Dirichlet + pretty much every distribution that came up during our undergraduate course except for binomial and multinomial)

Next on the topic of *"close"*, note I did not use the word *distance*, since *distance* between two distributions entails both symmetry and positive definiteness. The default "closeness" function `$c()$` that is used in VI is in fact the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:
`$$KL(q(\theta)|| p(\theta | X))$$`
which is definitely **not symmetric**. While it seems to be a reasonable function to choose for measuring closeness between two distributions, we can certainly question:
1. why KL? Why not other metrics?
2. why did we choose the order of divergence to be `$q||p$` but not `$p||q$`

the short answer for the first question is that - because it makes maths simpler and it is **shown** to provide good approximations. The complete maths for VI is as follows, our objective is:
`$$q^{*}=\operatorname{argmin}_{q \in Q} \operatorname{KL}(q(\theta) \| p(\theta | X))$$`
we know under KL measurement, if `$Q$` covers all the distributions there are, we just need to set `$q(\theta)=p(\theta | X)$` to achieve `$\operatorname{KL}=0$`. But **we do not know what the posterior is**, nor do we want to calculate it via that intractable integral. Instead, we write KL in it's full form:
`$$\operatorname{KL}(q(\theta) \| p(\theta | X)) = \int_\theta q(\theta) \log \frac{q(\theta)}{p(\theta | X)} d \theta \quad [1]$$`
and re-write the posterior:
`$$\operatorname{KL}(\cdots)=\int_\theta q(\theta) \log \frac{q(\theta) p(X)}{p(\theta, X)} d \theta=\log p(X)-\int_\theta q(\theta) \log \frac{p(\theta, X)}{q(\theta)} d \theta \quad [2]$$`
and recall `$p(X)$` term is intractable, but it does not depend on `$q$`, hence to find the optimum `$q$` we completely avoided this intractable term! `$p(\theta, X)$` can be evaluated easily since we needed it to construct our model in the first place (step one of the three procedures in the previous section).  Our objective function becomes:
`$$q^* = \operatorname{argmax}_{q \in Q}\int_\theta q(\theta) \log \frac{p(\theta, X)}{q(\theta)} d \theta$$`
(argmax because we are minimising the negative). This objective function is given the confusing name "Evidence lower bound" (ELBO), because if we look at equation `$[2]$`, KL divergence is none-negative, the evidence term `$\log p(X)$` is a constant, hence the remaining term is a lower bound on the evidence term.
I find this ELBO objective more intuitive by expanding it fully:
`$$q^{*}=\operatorname{argmax}_{q \in Q}\text{ELBO} = \int_\theta q(\theta) \log p(\theta, X)d\theta - \int_\theta q(\theta)\log q(\theta)$$`
`$$ = \operatorname{argmax}_{q \in Q} \mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim q}[p(\theta, X)] + \mathcal{H}(q(\theta))$$`
where `$\mathcal{H}(q(\theta))$` is the entropy of our posterior approximation (a.k.a variational distribution). We see maximising the ELBO objective has two contradictive and competing sub-objectives:
1. `$\mathbb{E}_{\theta \sim q}[p(\theta, X)]$` can be seen as maxising the likelihood of our dataset being generated by our parameters (drawn from `$q$`) and our model (fixed). **Prefers point estimates of `$\theta$`**
2. `$\mathcal{H}(q(\theta))$` entropy term, which **prefers uncertain estimates of `$\theta$`**

It is these two competing objectives that makes Bayesian inference so attractive, and less prone to overfitting! i.e. we want a good fit to our dataset but also uncertainty in our parameters.

To summarise, variational inference aims to approximate the intractable posterior `$p(\theta|X)$` with some "nice" distribution `$q^*(\theta)$`. Approximation is turned into an optimisation problem, where the objective function is ELBO: `$$q^{*}=\operatorname{argmax}_{q \in Q} \mathrm{ELBO} = \operatorname{argmax}_{q \in Q} \int_{\theta} q(\theta) \log \frac{p(\theta, X)}{q(\theta)} d \theta$$`
{: .notice}

Now we circle back to an earlier problem we raised - why did we take `$\text{KL}(q||p)$`? Why not `$\text{KL}(p||q)$`. In short, inspecting equation `$[1]$`, had we taken the divergence the other way round, we would end up taking expectation over our intractable posterior `$p(\theta|X)$`. This sort of maximisation is actually still possible, and is termed *Belief-Propagation* (which will not be discussed here). What is the effect of the order? Observe that:
`$$\mathrm{KL}(q(x) \| p(x)) = \int_x q(x)\dfrac{q(x)}{p(x)} dx $$`
in the cases where `$p(x)$` is very close or equal to zero (i.e. low-likelihood regions), the only way to minimise the divergence is to **ensure `$q(x)$` is close to zero at these locations**. Hence we say that `$\mathrm{KL}(q\| p)$` is **zero-seeking**. Similar argument may be made for `$\mathrm{KL}(p\| q)$` which is called **zero-avoiding**. This is more intuitive through graphical visualisation. Suppose we want to approximate a bimodal distribution with a Gaussian, graphs below shows the behaviour of the two minimisation methods:

<p></p>

where the blue line is the true posterior `$p(\theta|X)$`, red lines are our variational approximations. So methods with `$q||p$` tends to **under estimate** the posterior variance, c.f. over estimation in `$p||q$`. Both can be quiet bad if you think about the real-life impact (under estimating uncertainty in getting cancer and over estimating it). A lot of research is done on finding alternative methods/metrics, which of course is beyong the scope of this post.
